# This file configures the static analysis results for your project (errors,
# warnings, and lints).
#
# This enables the 'recommended' set of lints from `package:lints`.
# This set helps identify many issues that may lead to problems when running
# or consuming Dart code, and enforces writing Dart using a single, idiomatic
# style and format.
#
# If you want a smaller set of lints you can change this to specify
# 'package:lints/core.yaml'. These are just the most critical lints
# (the recommended set includes the core lints).
# The core lints are also what is used by pub.dev for scoring packages.

# Uncomment the following section to specify additional rules.

# linter:
#   rules:
#     - camel_case_types

# analyzer:
#   exclude:
#     - path/to/excluded/files/**

# For more information, see https://dart.dev/guides/language/analysis-options

# TODO: Remove this section if you don't use lints.
#       The lints package is an opinionated set of lint recommendations
#       from the Dart team. Start with these and add/remove lint rules
#       as necessary.
